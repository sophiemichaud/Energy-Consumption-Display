# Energy-Consumption-Display

This is a in-home energy consumption display project. The display unit was created by developping a hardware interface in addition to a software interface using C and ARM Assembly with the Keil uVision software package. Two software interfaces were developed: one for testing through the Putty terminal and the other for loading onto the K60 Microcontroller.
